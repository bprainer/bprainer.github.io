                      <p>We all have a mix of geniuses, but we have one that is more dominant and when we focus at it, we can focus on our natural leadership style that suits our strengths -- and allow others to do the same.<br>
					  Here are the four geniuses. Which one of these do you resonate with the most?
					  </p><br>
					  <ul>
						<li><b>Dynamo Geniuses</b> are Ideas Smart<br>
							<p>	Dynamo Geniuses include Richard Branson, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Michael Jackson, Beethoven, Thomas Edison, and Albert Einstein.
								Related to "Spring" energy, all of these people focused their strengths in creating. They ignored those who criticized them for not being organized or social enough. They didn't worry about being forgetful or missing the small things. They are all remembered today for their creative brilliance, because they were best at answering the question, "What?"
								Dynamos lead through task-based leadership. As Richard Branson says "I believe in benevolent dictatorship provided I am the dictator."
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Blaze Geniuses</b> are People Smart<br>
							<p>	Blaze Geniuses include Bill Clinton, Jack Welch, Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres, and Larry King.
								Related to "Summer" energy, all of these charismatic people focused on their strengths in leadership and connections. They ignored those who criticized them for not focusing on the numbers or not planning enough.
								They never worried that they changed focus too often or didn't like being stuck in an office. They just got out there to make a difference through people, with fun and variety, because they were best at answering the question, "Who?"
								Blazes lead through communication. Summed up by Jack Welch: "In leadership you have to exaggerate every statement you make. You've got to repeat it a thousand times and exaggerate it."
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Tempo Geniuses</b> are Senses Smart<br>
							<p>	Tempo Geniuses include Warren Buffett, George Soros, Woodrow Wilson, Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, and Michael Phelps.
								Related to "Autumn" energy, all of these people focused on their strengths in their senses and perseverance. They ignored those who criticized them for not being more forceful or politically astute. They didn't worry that they liked being extra careful and wanted to take more time over things.
								They just stayed calm and grounded, taking their time, because they were best at answering the question, "When?"
								Tempos lead through servant leadership. As Woodrow Wilson said, "The ear of the leader must ring with the voices of the people."
							</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Steel Geniuses</b> are Details Smart<br>
							<p>	Steel Geniuses include famous entrepreneurs such as John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, Ray Kroc, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Mark Zuckerberg.
								Related to "Winter" energy, all of these people focused on their strengths in systems and in managing data. They ignored those who criticized them for not having better social skills or being more sensitive.
								They didn't worry that they often liked being alone and often did their best work when locked away. They just kept focused on finding smarter ways to do things through their systems, because they were best at answering the question, "How?"
								Steels lead through systems-driven leadership. As Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonalds said, ""The quality of a leader is reflected in the standards they set for themselves."
